    "description": "<div><br /></div><div>Seam builds digital and physical infrastructure to enable software developers to connect their applications with the physical devices around us</div><div class=\"truncate text-base text-white underline\"><a href=\"https://getseam.com/\">https://getseam.com/</a></div><div class=\"truncate text-base text-white underline\"><br /></div><div class=\"truncate text-base text-white underline\"><br /></div><div class=\"truncate text-base text-white underline\"><h2>What We Do</h2><p>Seam builds an API for IoT devices. This lets developers unlock doors, set access codes, turn off thermostats, read sensors and more\u00e2\u0080\u0094all using a single API that works across brands and standardizes common device functions.</p><h2>Who We Are</h2><p>Our team were early engineers at Nest, Github, Sonder, Square...etc. We shipped millions of IoT devices and built dev tools used by every developer on earth. We are advised by the amazing Bunnie Huang and backed by YC and some of the best hard-tech investors.</p><h2>Overview</h2><p>We are looking for software engineers, preferably proficient in Typescript. This role will involve a number of projects up and down our stack. We like people that are comfortable moving around.</p><h2>Backend API</h2><p>Our high-level goal is to build a device/manufacturer agnostic integration layer that connects to various devices and exposes their functionality through a simple API. This task involves integrating dozens of different IoT brands and their protocols (z-wave, zigbee, bacnet, OEM API...etc) and neatly organizing them amongst common functionality.</p><p>This is one of our client libraries. The unlock functionality presented here works the exact same way across dozen of brands.</p><h2>Seam Connect</h2><p>This is an embeddable UX flow that developers add to their applications. It then allows their applications' users to grant access to their devices. Seam Connect guides users through selecting their device brands, entering their credentials, and dealing with edge cases like 2FA or multi-tenant accounts. For example, Airbnb can ask their host for access to their smart locks and thermostats. This then enables Airbnb to automate guest access and save energy while the unit is unoccupied.</p><h2>Client Libraries</h2><p>We often ponder how to create the best developer experience possible for our customers. To that end, we're big believers in client libraries over just offering a pure HTTP API. Though that API is available and documented, our customers have told us that being able to not think about the underlying HTTP requests makes our product enjoyable to work with. Some of our customers even suggest and implement changes to our client libraries!</p><h2>Our Libraries:</h2><ul><li><a href=\"https://github.com/hello-seam/seamapi-javascript\">Javascript/Typescript</a>\u00c2\u00a0\u00e2\u0086\u0092\u00c2\u00a0<strong>npm install seamapi</strong></li><li><a href=\"https://github.com/hello-seam/seamapi-python\">Python</a>\u00c2\u00a0\u00e2\u0086\u0092\u00c2\u00a0<strong>pip install seamapi</strong></li></ul><h2>Stack</h2><p>We primarily write Seam using Typescript. We also believe that \"best DevOps is no DevOps.\" To that end, we're trying to use serverless to run our entire infra. Let's just say this hasn't been without its challenges :) But we're trying different things and always open to new ideas! Our primary datastore is Postgres.</p></div>",

This is quite informal, and we use it to discuss technical approaches, ask for help, arrange code reviews, talk about anything cool we just shipped, and figure out what the day's priorities are.</p><p><strong>Focus time:\u00c2\u00a0</strong>After that we'll generally focus for the rest of the day, asking for help / ad-hoc pairing / code reviews over slack.</p><p><strong>Small bites</strong>:\u00c2\u00a0We try to break things down into somewhere between a few hours and a few days' work, so that we merge frequently and nobody gets 'stuck' on a card.</p><p><strong>Consensus</strong>: Larger tech decisions get broken out separately, on an \"all welcome, all optional\" basis. We generally make technical/architectural decisions by consensus. Sometimes we'll spike a couple of different approaches and do short presentations to the team about what we've learned.</p><p><strong>Independence:\u00c2\u00a0</strong>High-level product direction and priorities come from our Product Owner, but we have a fair bit of flexibility as a team about how we implement them. This means that people can often choose what they want to work on. It also means that if you have cool ideas about what we can / should add to the experience to blow players' minds, they'll be very welcome (and you may end up building them). <br />\u00e2\u0080\u008d</p><h3>Cool stuff we've done recently</h3><p>One of our games has a \"magic camera\" - a scripted NPC will ask you to take a photo of a particular prop inside the New York experience building, and then react differently based on whether you located and photographed the right one. We 3D-printed some test props, took some photos of them, used those to train the AI, and integrated it into the app.</p><p>As a team we figured out a way to synchronise the audio/video events in the HQ to the app as players walk through, using a Raspberry PI as a configurable iBeacon.</p><p>We modified one of our interactive exhibits to broadcast a proposal in 6-foot-high letters across an entire wall of the codebreaking room, at exactly the right moment.

Better ask for forgiveness instead of permission, no one will be accused of trying. We try to keep things simple because complexity slows us down.\n\nIt's not about the time spent, but the outcome achieved.

We believe in the basic Agile principle of \"Release early and release often\". This approach helps us manage risk and make better decisions by creating fast feedback loops between ourselves and our users. \nWe design software **API First**. Before we write a single line of code, we design the APIs of a service in a way that any other team, whether internal to epilot or external, can use the APIs interface with our service without prior knowledge.\n\nDoes this sound like an environment you want to work in?

    "description": "You will be joining a small, all remote (4 person) engineering team, spread across Europe (UK, GR, CY, PL) with the opportunity to shape and lead all things front-end. Primarily you will be working on our [website](https://www.mote.com/), [Chrome extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/mote-voice-notes-feedback/ajphlblkfpppdpkgokiejbjfohfohhmk?hl=en) (in [Google's own top 12 extensions of 2021]( https://gadgets360.com/apps/news/google-favourite-chrome-extensions-2021-download-loom-mote-wordtune-forest-dark-reader-tab-manager-plus-2644345)!), and nascent embed and SDK strategy.\n\n\n## About mote\n\nMote is a two year-old, Silicon Valley VC-backed, web audio recorder company. Our initial market focus has been in education (K12 and Higher Education), where our extension saw dramatic worldwide adoption during the pandemic. We are increasingly exploring entering the enterprise marketplace, as a tool for teams to leave messages and give feedback.\n\n## About you\n*  **Amazing player-coach:** an exemplary contributor of maintainable, clean, correct, performant, elegant code, but cares even more about making the team around them smarter, faster, happier.\n*  **Not your first rodeo:** You have been around the block enough times to have acquired a playbook of how to build high performing software teams (especially on the front-end), having strongly held evidence-based opinions on the practises and technologies which add or subtract from that.\n*  **Missionary not mercenary:** You have checked out mote website, and are intrigued by its potential. You want to stick around a few years to see where it can go.\n\n## The stack you will be working on\n\nThe current front-end stack is built with ReactJS, JavaScript, styled components, and a fairly usual suspect modern toolchain of Webpack, Jest, Cypress, Playwright, yarn workspaces, Storybook, Github, CircleCI, CloudFront, Sentry and Datadog. We are open-minded though currently underinvested in other languages which compile to JS (eg TypeScript, Elm, CoffeeScript etc).\n\nThe back-end is built with Python, Flask, Redis, Dynamo, ECS, S3 and sprinklings of Azure and GCP. A desire to contribute to back-end API implementation is welcomed if full stack feature ownership is strongly desired as a preferred way of working, but is very far from an essential requirement.\n\nWhile our back-end has heavy test automation investment, we have made substantially less proportional investment on the front-end. The right person will want to lead the charge on paying back tech debt in this area.\n\n## Mote culture\n\n* Mote is a remote-only startup, comprising a small team distributed across many time zones and locations. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099re genuinely mission-driven and we find our work exciting and rewarding. There\u00e2\u0080\u0099s never a shortage of work to do, but we value maintaining work-life balance.\n* To excel in this role at Mote, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re the kind of person who can prioritise effectively, and then stay in \u00e2\u0080\u0098heads down\u00e2\u0080\u0099 mode to get the job done.\n* As a member of a remote team, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll be happy working independently, but you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll know how to work collaboratively using asynchronous tools like Mote, Loom and Slack. As a general rule, we try to minimise time spent in scheduled meetings, preferring to \u00e2\u0080\u0098jump on a zoom\u00e2\u0080\u0099 to work through a difficult problem when necessary.\n* As a \u00e2\u0080\u0098Motey\u00e2\u0080\u0099, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll be expected to challenge colleagues - to push back firmly and politely when you disagree, but you try your best to bring the team along with you by explaining your thinking.\n\n\n## Requirements\n\n* You are already a senior front-end engineer or tech lead, with at least 5 years experience at fast-growth consumer and/or SaaS tech companies.\n* You have had enough experience of leading or influencing teams as a senior, that you feel you want to take the next step and own more ownership and responsibility in the success of a front-end team.\n* Demonstrable command of working with production JavaScript/TypeScript codebases\n* You either have formal degree-level training in Computer Science or can demonstrate solid evidence of self-taught solid grasp of fundamentals.\n* You have demonstrated you are a high impact individual contributor combining high levels of accuracy, rigour and output.\n* You have excellent judgement on engineering trade-offs, with a fine-tuned sense of when to pick between accruing more tech debt, leaving as is but increasing tests, refactoring or wholesale rewriting.\n* You have previously championed and lead meaningful investments in test automation (using Jest, Playwright, Cypress etc) and nuanced opinions on test pyramids, ice cream cones and honeycombs.\n* You live by the \u00e2\u0080\u009cno asshole\u00e2\u0080\u009d rule, demonstrating high levels of empathy for peers, non-technical colleagues and users.\n\nWe have a cut-down version of our web offering in the iOS App Store (built with React Native). This may become an area of increased investment. Experience of React Native is desirable but not essential.\n\n\n## Benefits\n\n* Competitive salary\n* Stock option plan\n* Leave package\n* Work from home\n* Flexible hours\n* Working with an amazing team\n",

Trying to get the last decimals to match so your auditor doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t scream at you?\nWe would prefer to spend time with family or friends. The same goes for our customers.\nAt Likvido we are automating accounting for our customers. We do this by having a super awesome product that helps you:\n* Send \u00e2\u0080\u009csmart invoices\u00e2\u0080\u009d that reconcile themselves\n* Send automatic reminders for invoices that go unpaid\n* Pay your bills in Likvido so you don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have to go to your bank (and the bills of course reconcile themselves)\n* Automatically scan all your receipts and bills so you don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have to enter data again\n* Get paid if an invoice has not been paid on time through our debt collection system\n\nIf you *really* hate accounting, we also have an accountant service where our accountants take care of everything for a small price.\nSo to summarize what Likvido is doing:\nWe are letting you focus on what matters, instead of spending time on boring administrative work.\n# Tech stack\nOur main application is a web application, where our customers can interact with the product. This web application consists of a VueJS frontend and an API - using the Backend For Frontend (BFF) approach. This means we are evolving the frontend and API in a symbiosis, where the API requests are tailored to the exact use-cases of the frontend. The styling of the frontend is a custom-made look designed by our in-house UX/UI designer in cooperation with Studio Skulptur: https://www.studioskulptur.com/likvido.\nWe use StoryBook to keep track of our Vue components. We are generally very open to adopting new technologies, whenever they provide some nice improvements over our current stack. One of the next steps we are considering is to upgrade from Vue 2 to Vue 3 as well as switch to TypeScript - but we need your input as well here!\nYou will join our current team, consisting of 9 colleagues, both frontend and full-stack developers, plus a product team with UX/UI designers and product managers.\n# Responsibilities\nBeing a Senior Frontend Developer at Likvido, your job is to build awesome products. We want to \u00e2\u0080\u009cwow\u00e2\u0080\u009d our customers.\nDay-to-day that means you will:\n* Implement new visual changes (HTML + CSS + JavaScript preferably in Vue.js)\n* Be responsible for the frontend technical stack in the solution in cooperation with the current team\n* Make sure we continue building and improving our \u00e2\u0080\u009cnice and reusable\u00e2\u0080\u009d UI components\n* Make code reviews and be responsible for the JavaScript & HTML+CSS in the solution\n* Help push forward our platform and codebase, to make sure it is easy to maintain and performs well\n* Give feedback and input towards the design and interactivity of the site. It is important that you help make the site more user friendly and beautiful\n\nYou will participate in the development process, just like your colleagues do, which means maintaining the current codebase, adding new features, doing code reviews etc. We are moving towards forming small autonomous teams, with a very high level of ownership and influence over the product and the technologies. This environment provides a lot of freedom for the teams to take control over their work, and let their creativity unfold.\n# Requirements\nWe are looking for someone who can say \u00e2\u0080\u009cYES!\u00e2\u0080\u009d to the following:\n* I am a senior frontend developer with 5+ years of experience\n* I have multiple years of experience building a modern JavaScript stack. Also, I am familiar with build tools such as Webpack/Rollup and know how to set them up to use the latest JS features (ESNext) and new CSS specs.\n* I am up-to-date on the latest JS & CSS specs and know best practices around modern state management (like Redux, Vuex). This is important because we always strive to leverage the new technologies that make our lives easier.\n* I know how to set up a modern stack that makes use of client-side routing and offers all the things you\u00e2\u0080\u0099d expect from a modern SPA, such as offline support, service workers, push notifications, etc.\n* Bonus: Experience writing unit tests as we want to cover the most critical areas with good tests, and we are already very far here\n\nSo without further ado: If you consider yourself a top frontend developer, and feel like having a very ambitious role is the next step in your career - APPLY!\n# Practicalities\n* You will work 100% remote along with our existing team\n* We work within CET office hours but are flexible to accommodate other schedules\n* We pay a good salary\n* We expect you to be fluent in English\n* The position is full-time\n* Your manager will be operating from Denmark",

    "description": "* Full-time permanent role\n* Work remotely or relocate and be based out of Sydney, Australia\n* Visa and relocation support available (subject to conditions) \n* Different salary ranges for relocating employees\n* You will need to work 9 - 1pm AEST / AEDT, flexible on your other 4 hours per day\n* Simple hiring process: 3 interviews + code exercise\n\nWrite code day-to-day and up skill those around you.\n\nDo you enjoy coaching others and working with colleagues who help each other develop their skills every day? We partner with our clients to deliver projects and new product features every day, whilst helping to develop the skills, knowledge and capability of those around us in the team. You'll have the opportunity to work in Product Development teams in different domains, both greenfield products as well as evolving existing ones.\n\nWhy are we looking for polyglot developers? Well, we know everyone has their favourite language or framework, but we also know that it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s important to use the right tool/language/framework for the job at hand, and that a pragmatic approach might mean using a language that is already in production. Also, polyglot and/or agnostic developers tend to focus on core software engineering principles and practices, rather than what is shiny in a new framework or language. So whilst we usually work with JavaScript it doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t mean we aren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t able to transfer our engineering skills and work with other languages when it makes sense.\n\nThrough regular Learning Lunches, Technical Brown Bags, Software Crafters Meetups, Start of Week meetings, Team Offsites and other social and community events, our team learns and collaborates together and is always sharing knowledge and helping each other, both within Pragmateam, clients and the community.\n\nTo be successful in this role you must have an open mind to sometimes work with a language that is not your usual one and most likely consider yourself a polyglot, ie. someone who is happy to learn new languages or further develop their skills if needed for the task at hand. You must also love developing the skills of other software engineers and helping them improve their craft and capability. The ability and passion to coach others and make things a little bit better is part of the job, so having the empathy and soft skills to do it is important.\n\n**Why it's good\u00e2\u0080\u00a6**\n\n* Opportunity to work across a variety of domains, with different problem spaces and technologies.\n* Able to share your knowledge and develop the skills of those around you, whilst writing code and learning every day.\n* Be a member of a cross-functional agile team delivering together end-to-end.\n* Working in a stable product team (ie. we don't like pure project work) provides a lot of job satisfaction as you are an integral part of the product development process.\n* We work in clients employing continuous delivery practices such as CI, automated testing and continuous deployment.\n* We prefer to work for medium or small product companies instead of large enterprises, as it's easier to be set up for success, have a positive impact and influence.\n* We choose our work and often say no, so people like the work that we do around here.\n* Education & Work From Home budget of $4,000 that you manage yourself: decide if you want to go to a conference, spend it all on books or dedicate yourself to an online training course, all while having a professional, productive and comfortable setup for when you're WFH\n* The 'team' in 'Pragmateam' does mean something: we are never by ourselves in clients so that we can support each other and deliver together.\n* We are curious and have a culture of continuous improvement so we are always keen to learn more and improve ourselves and Pragmateam.\n\n\n**To be successful in the role you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll have the following skills:**\n\n* Extensive commercial experience (usually 6+ years) in developing custom built web applications, ideally having worked with JavaScript and some of the usual (or unusual) Javascript frameworks such as React, Angular, VueJS. On the back-end you might have worked witih node.js, .Net, Go or Kotlin to name a few.\n* Solid experience working in teams that use XP practices (eg. CI, TDD, pairing, small releases).\n* Support and coach others as well as help teams improve and develop their capabilities, through pairing, Coding Dojos, Dev Guilds, Brown Bags, mentoring, influencing, 1-on-1's etc.\n* Experience across the full tech stack with an interest in developing software both backend and front end (a bias to one side is normal and totally fine).\n* Experience with TDD and the benefits of writing tests first before starting on your code.\n* Solid experience refactoring code, ability to describe different refactoring techniques.\n* Experience with Object Oriented programming and able to discuss design patterns.\n* Passion for writing Clean Code, so everyone in the team can understand it.\n* Awareness of distributed architectures and micro-services and interest to learn more.\n\n**Our Recruitment Process**\n\n* Phone interview (30-60 minutes)\n* Test Coverage exercise (2-3 hours)\n* Pairing + Tech Interview (45-90 minutes)\n* Management Interview (60 minutes)\n\n\nInterested?

    "description": "*Barsala is working to unlock unique locations to stay in cities across the globe.*\n\nEvery building needs Barsala. Building owners work tirelessly to bring on new, creative developments into cities that enable people to explore the area in a unique way and feel inspired while doing so. Developing buildings is high risk, and Barsala increases the chances that the building owner will make a return on their investment by monetizing their vacant apartments.\n\nTravelers have evolved over time. Hotels aren't friendly for those staying for extended periods of time, and other rental options has a lack of consistency that leaves the traveler wondering if the owner will accidentally open the door to their room.\n\nBarsala offers fully furnished, livable spaces for remote workers, business travelers, digital nomads, and anyone else who is looking for a better way to stay. These come equipped with a washer/dryer and kitchen, and they provide unique opportunities for people to explore new cities.\n\n**About the Role**\n\nBarsala is looking for a product-focused engineer that can implement creative solutions across a variety of products, and build world class technology for our guests and building partners.\n\n**What You'll Do:**\n\n* Build key components of the Barsala platform: \n    * A world-class hotel suite of guest applications that empowers them to take full advantage of their stays\n    * Includes our web platform, mobile app, checkin form, and the API that powers all of them\n    * Smart home and building IoT integrations for a next generation hospitality experience\n    * Identity verification and improvements to our fraud detection services\n    * Applications for our building owners to help manage and improve their experience with Barsala\n* Collaborate with stakeholders across the world to drive teams towards high impact\n* Help us grow our new team by interviewing and recruiting new engineers\n* Develop a culture of high ownership, innovation, empathy, and collaboration\n* Make investments in engineering reliability, productivity, and excellence\n\n**Why you might be excited about us**\n* We\u00e2\u0080\u0099re building the future of travel. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099re a passionate team of individuals that love to travel and explore new cities, and we take that energy into building an experience that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s unlike what exists today \u00f0\u009f\u0098\u008e\n* You\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll work closely and communicate directly with product owners at Barsala and work with them to build the right solutions to the problems they face\n* You'll quickly have responsibility over big areas of our products.\n* The future is very bright - we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve bootstrapped the company to ~1,000 properties across 12 different cities. We've recently raised a round of funding and are looking to accelerate this growth in 2022! \u00f0\u009f\u009a\u0080\n\n**Why you might not be excited about us**\n* We're a relatively small team, so if you like more established teams, it's not (yet) the right time. You'll help build our company's culture.\n* Since we're still a startup, projects and priorities may shift.\n* Since you'll have a lot of responsibility and creativity over projects, they may not be defined perfectly initially. You'll be expected to bring your own experience and perspective to help us do the right things, and raise flags if you think we should do things differently.\n\n**About you**\n* Minimum 4 years of experience designing, building, enterprise-grade or consumer-facing software \n* Strong proficiency in Node, React and React Native, and preferably Next.js\n* Experience or confidence in their ability to lead teams to accomplish projects end to end\n* Detail-oriented, has a muscle for making trade-offs between technical perfection and time to go live\n* Strong communication skills and comfortable collaborating with non-technical stakeholders\n* Successful track record in challenging engineering roles within startups\n* Comfortable establishing standards in codebases for others to follow\n\n**Why Barsala?**\n* Generous equity compensation\n* Annual credits and discounted rates to Barsala properties \u00e2\u009c\u0088\u00ef\u00b8\u008f\n* WeWork membership reimbursement\n* Professional development reimbursement\n* Home office & technology reimbursement\n* Remote work opportunities\n* Opportunity to:\n    * Grow as a technical leader within our engineering team, getting experience coordinating with other engineers and mentoring them\n    * Gain technical ownership over numerous products \n* Exact title flexible based on level of experience\n* We provide medical, dental and vision insurance",

In a world of constraining internet connections and paid services, we think differently: we are building a free, \u00e2\u0080\u009clow-tech\u00e2\u0080\u009d friendly platform for everyone to jump in, directly from their browser. Our platform is social by design and packed with fun games curated by our community.

We are building a social gaming platform for all gamers who enjoy playing together.\n\nOur startup has been growing very quickly since the end of 2020, attracting more than 40 gaming talents from developers and social media experts to designers. In June 2021, we introduced our cloud gaming beta platform featuring 80+ licensed games, including titles from industry-renowned publishers such as Codemasters, Interplay, Team 17, and Data East. Discovered and supported by Y Combinator (Twitch, Reddit, Stripe, etc), our board of advisors include former SEGA CEO Kenji Matsubara, Zynga co-founders Justin Waldron and Tom Bollich, Crunchyroll\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Kun Gao, and Humble Bundle\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Jeffrey Rosen. \n\nWith almost half a million users who have joined us so far, our teams are prepping for our next chapter and are on the lookout for talented and motivated folks who share our passion  for gaming and want to make a real impact while embracing a true startup spirit (autonomy, transparency, user centric).\n\nPiepacker is an equal opportunity employer and we proudly value and promote diversity in our team. We do not discriminate on the basis of ethnicity, religion, color, national origin, gender, sexual orientation, age, marital status, World of Warcraft faction or disability status.\n\nMore info here on our mission, culture and team!",

    "description": "We're an all-senior/staff dev team building the next gen of insurance that doesn't suck. We're looking for a product-minded engineer to join us.  Steadily is a year and half old, 50 people-strong, and we recently announced our $30M funding round -- things are going swimmingly.  \n\nBecause this isn't our first rodeo (2 prior exits), we're building Steadily to make a lasting dent in the universe.  Here's how we operate: https://www.steadily.com/culture/\n\n## What You\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll Do:\n* Combine property intelligence for external sources to estimate how likely a property is to flood, catch on fire, or get vandalized\n* Create a claim app that uses phone camera and sensors to document the damage smartly\n* Construct a mobile experience for people to buy insurance that is so simple/intuitive that your least-tech savvy relative with a flip-phone could use it without help e.g. pass the Mom Test\n* Build rating engines for calculating how much an insurance policy should cost\n\n## What You'll Bring:\n**Experienced**: This isn't your first rodeo. There's no specific minimum number of years requirement, but we expect you to be able to dive into a complex codebase without too much spin-up. Past experience as a team lead is definitely a plus.\n\n**Builder**: You like the product-side of engineering and have thoughtful opinions on what the user experience should be. You're not the type of engineer who wants a fully-fleshed out spec thrown over the wall for you to code.\n\n**Pragmatic**: Let's say you have a tradeoff to make: Option A is to ship something fast using an off-the-shelf API on AWS; you won't learn that much and it only solves 80% of the problem, but it'll only take a few days. Option B is to invest about two weeks building a new library and internally-hosted service that perfectly solves the problem; as a bonus you can share it on Github and give a presentation about it at PyCon. If you choose Option A 10/10 then you'll be at home here.\n\n**Language-agnostic**: We don't really care if you've worked in our stack before as long as you're happy to learn it. If you're sharp enough to be on this team, you're sharp enough to learn any language or framework quickly.\n\n## Our Stack:\n* Python 3\n* Django\n* Postgres\n* Heroku (with full CI pipeline)\n* Redis / Celery\n* Kafka\n\n## Compensation & Benefits:\n* Starting at $250,000\n* Equity\n* 401K\n* Flexible Time Off \n* Health (HSA or FSA), vision, and dental insurance\n* Equipment provided\n\n## Why Steadily?\nAt Steadily you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll be able to work with other brilliant, driven teammates who care about doing the best work of their lives. We have high expectations of each other, but are dedicated to supporting each other in those expectations and making Steadily a huge success.\n\nIn order to do this, we believe in hiring top talent and encourage each team member to actively drive the culture we want at Steadily. This includes things like being light on processes where you manage your own workload. You know your job best, so we won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t micromanage how you get the job done (we provide context, not control)! That said, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re also highly collaborative and go above and beyond to make sure that we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re all on the same page and have the tools we all need to succeed.\n\nWorking at a startup isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t easy, but it is incredibly rewarding. You\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll be able to see your actions directly impact the growth of the company, as well as your equity\u00e2\u0080\u0099s valuation, on a near-daily basis. The growth opportunity you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll have at Steadily will also greatly increase your career trajectory, giving you valuable experience that you\u00e2\u0080\u0099d be hard pressed to find anywhere else.\n\nWe\u00e2\u0080\u0099re excited to meet you!",
